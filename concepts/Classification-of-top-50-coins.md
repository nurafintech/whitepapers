# Classifying coin into 3 categories

Here  we are trying to classify coins into 3 categories including finance platform, loaning platform and stable coins. We just go through top 50 coins in the market based on coinmarketcap.com website.


## Stable Coins

- **Tether (USDT)** : Tether propose a method to maintain a one-­to-one reserve ratio between a cryptocurrency token, called tethers, and its associated real ­world asset, fiat currency tokens and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves. This method uses the Bitcoin blockchain, Proof of Reserves, and other audit methods to prove that issued tokens are fully backed and reserved at all times.

- **USD Coin (USDC)**: USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis meaning every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. Centre stable coins are issued by regulated and licensed financial institutions that maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency.

- **Dai (DAI)**: DAI is an Ethereum-based stable coin and The price of it is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar and is collateralized by a mix of other cryptocurrencies that are deposited into smart-contract vaults every time new DAI is minted. The key advantage of DAI is the fact that it is managed not by a private company, but rather by a decentralized autonomous organization via a software protocol.

- **TrueUSD (TUSD)**: TrueUSD is one of a number of cryptocurrency stablecoins administered by TrustToken, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets.TrustToken describes TUSD as “the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar.”

## NFT

- **Flow (FLOW)**:Flow is a fast, decentralized, and layer-one blockchain, designed as the foundation for a new generation of games, apps, and the digital assets that power them. The Flow architecture which is splitting consensus (selection and ordering of transactions) from compute (executing each transaction and recording its output) can dramatically increase throughput without compromising security.

- **ApeCoin (APE)**: ApeCoin is an ERC-20 governance and utility token used within the APE Ecosystem to empower and incentivize a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3. ApeCoin holders govern themselves via the decentralized governance framework controlling the ApeCoin DAO, and vote on how the ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem Fund should be used.

- **Decentraland (MANA)**:Decentraland defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications. MANA is an ERC-20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens (the second token Decentraland uses). MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace. 

-  **Tezos (XTZ)**: Tezos is a blockchain network that’s based on smart contracts and aims to offer infrastructure that can evolve and improve over time without there ever being a danger of a hard fork. Participants in Tezos can get involved with the network’s governance through “baking,” where they effectively stake 8,000 XTZ. This creates a financial incentive to act honestly.

- **The Sandbox (SAND)**:The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community. The platform focuses on facilitating a creative “play-to-earn” model, which allows users to be both creators and gamers simultaneously. 

- **Axie Infinity (AXS)**:Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players allowing them to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies. Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT). The Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique governance token, known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS).

- **Theta Network (THETA)**: Theta is a blockchain powered network purpose-built for video streaming. The Theta mainnet operates as a decentralized network in which users share bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. The platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems.

## Loaning

- **Maker (MKR)**:Maker is the governance token of the MakerDAO (a decentralized organization) and Maker Protocol (a software platform) that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin. MKR tokens act as a kind of voting share for the organization that manages DAI; while they do not pay dividends to their holders, they do give the holders voting rights over the development of Maker Protocol and are expected to appreciate in value in accordance with the success of DAI itself.

- **Aave (AAVE)**: Aave is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto. Lenders earn interest by depositing digital assets into specially created liquidity pools. Borrowers can then use their crypto as collateral to take out a flash loan using this liquidity. The project allows people to borrow and lend in about 20 cryptocurrencies, meaning that users have a greater amount of choice.

## DeFi 

- **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**: Wrapped Bitcoin is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that runs on the Ethereum  blockchain allowing it to be fully integrated into the latter’s ecosystem of decentralized exchanges, crypto lending services, prediction markets and other ERC-20-enabled DeFi applications. WBTC is also backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio and allows users to transfer liquidity between the BTC and the ETH networks in a decentralized and autonomous manner.

- **Avalanche (AVAX)**: Avalanche is the fastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality. On Avalanche you can build fast, low cost, Solidity-compatible dApps that confirm transactions instantly and process thousands of transactions per second. You can also deploy blockchains that fit your own application needs and build your own virtual machine and dictate exactly how the blockchain should operate. Its native token, AVAX, can be  staked or locked up to help process transactions and further secure the platform.

- **Uniswap (UNI)**: Uniswap, an example of an automated market maker (AMM), is a popular decentralized trading protocol, known for its role in facilitating automated trading of decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens. It also try to keep token trading automated and completely open to anyone who holds tokens, while improving the efficiency by solving liquidity issues with automated solutions, avoiding the problems which plagued the first decentralized exchanges.

- **Fantom (FTM)**: Fantom is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) smart contract platform providing decentralized finance (DeFi) services to developers. One of Fantom's key strengths is its performance and efficient transaction processing, namely thousands of transactions per second, where transactions are settled in 1-2 seconds, and the cost is fractions of a cent per transaction. The ecosystem is based on two main technologies: Lachesis protocol and Opera.
