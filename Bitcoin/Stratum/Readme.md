# Stratum 
The stratum overlay protocol was extended to support pooled mining as a replacement for
obsolete getwork protocol in late 2012. The mining service specification was initially announced
via Slush's pool's website [2]. 

# Why Stratum? [4]
The main reason why I designed this protocol and implemented opensource pool server is that **the current getwork&LP mining protocol has many flaws and it can hardly be used in any large-scale setup.** 
<br/>
ASIC miners are probably coming at the end of the year 2012 :q, so Bitcoin community definitely needs some solution, which will easily scale to tera-hashes per second per pool user.

# Protocol Summary [1]
The Stratum protocol reduces client-server communications to levels that are usable with very low
bandwidth, and reduces the strain on servers drastically.
<br/>
**The key concept behind Stratum based mining is "push" based work**, where the server pushes
work to the miner, and the miner is able to utilize that work until the next push, regardless of the
hash rate.
<br/>
**This is done by allowing the miner to increase a counter in the coinbase transaction, and build a
new merkleroot for the block header, which effectively means the miner generates new work continuously without contacting the server.**


# HTTP: Communication is Driven by Miners [4]
HTTP was designed for web site browsing where clients ask servers for specific content. Pooled mining is different - server knows very well what clients need and can control the communication in a more efficient way. Let’s swap roles and leave orchestration to the server!
